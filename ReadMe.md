# Mini Project 2

 Use the Array operations that we discussed in the class to write a function that finds an answer to the following question.

**What is the highest imdb rated movie for a given minimum duration (in HOURS) and genre**

 The function you will write can be called using the statement found in the file. 
 -> console.log(getBestMovieBasedOn('Romance',2, mov));

 Do not modify that line.

***Please note that: The values of the "Runtime" property starts with a number followed by min. The minimum duration taken in by the function is in HOURS. The property representing the rating we are looking for is imdbRating**

## Expected Answer ## (From given call)
Forrest Gump released in 1994 is the highest rated Romance movie over 2 hour(s) long, with an imdb rating of 8.8
